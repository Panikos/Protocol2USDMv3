You are an expert at extracting structured data from clinical trial protocols.
Your task is to extract the Schedule of Activities (SoA) and return it as a JSON object graph conforming to the USDM v4.0 model.

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **Analyze and Classify the Study Design:** First, determine if the study is an **Interventional** or **Observational** study based on the protocol description.
2.  **Generate the Correct StudyDesign Object:** The `study.versions[0].studyDesigns` array must contain exactly ONE study design object. Based on your classification, you MUST generate either an `InterventionalStudyDesign` or an `ObservationalStudyDesign` object.

    *   **If Interventional:**
        *   Set `instanceType` to `InterventionalStudyDesign`.
        *   You MUST include the `trialType` attribute.
        *   Only include the fields listed below for `InterventionalStudyDesign`.

    *   **If Observational:**
        *   Set `instanceType` to `ObservationalStudyDesign`.
        *   You MUST include the `observationalStudyModel` attribute.
        *   Only include the fields listed below for `ObservationalStudyDesign`.

3.  **Adhere to the Schema:** For all other entities, use the fields and allowed values specified below.

**Schema Definitions:**

{entity_instructions}

**Output Rules:**

- Use unique IDs for all cross-referencing.
- The output MUST be a single JSON object that exactly matches the **Wrapper-Input** schema (top-level keys: `study`, `usdmVersion`).
- The `studyDesigns` object must also contain the `epochs` array. The `epochs` array should contain `StudyEpoch` objects. `StudyEpoch` objects contain `encounters`, which in turn contain `plannedTimepoints`. The `timeline` object should still contain the full list of `activities`.
- Include empty arrays/objects for any optional fields that are not present in the protocol.
- Set `usdmVersion` to `4.0.0`.
- Your final output must be ONLY the valid JSON object, with no explanations, comments, or markdown. The entire string you return must be directly consumable by `json.loads()`.

# Lean prompt template focused only on SoA timeline extraction, updated with better entity descriptions.
MINIMAL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert at extracting the Schedule of Activities (SoA) from a clinical trial protocol and converting it to a structured JSON object compliant with USDM v4.0.

Your task is to analyze the provided SoA table(s) and generate a JSON object containing the full timeline of study events.

**Key Concepts and Entity Relationships:**

The SoA is structured around a few core entities. Understanding their relationships is crucial for correct extraction:

*   **Epochs:** These are the major phases of the study (e.g., Screening, Treatment, Follow-up).
*   **Encounters:** These represent the specific visits or time windows within an Epoch (e.g., "Screening Visit", "Week 4 Visit").
*   **PlannedTimepoints:** These are the precise moments or intervals when activities happen. They are often linked to Encounters. (e.g., "Day 1", "Week 4").
*   **Activities:** These are the individual procedures or assessments performed (e.g., "Physical Exam", "Blood Draw").
*   **ActivityTimepoints:** This is the mapping that links an Activity to a PlannedTimepoint, indicating *what* happens *when*.
*   **ActivityGroups:** These are optional groupings for related activities (e.g., "Vital Signs").

**Your Task:**

Based on the protocol text, identify all instances of these entities and their relationships.

**Detailed Schema Definitions:**

Below are the specific fields you must use for each entity. Do not invent new fields or entity types.

{entity_instructions}

**Output Rules:**

1.  **JSON Only:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or comments outside of the JSON structure.
2.  **Schema Conformance:** The JSON must conform to the **Wrapper-Input** schema.
    *   Top-level keys must be `study` and `usdmVersion` (set to "4.0.0").
    *   The SoA data should be placed inside `study.versions[0]`. The `timeline` object within `versions[0]` should contain the core arrays.
3.  **Completeness:** Include all activities, timepoints, and groupings shown in the SoA table. If a piece of information is not present, you may use an empty array (`[]`).
4.  **Unique IDs:** Ensure all `id` fields are unique within the document so they can be used for cross-referencing.
