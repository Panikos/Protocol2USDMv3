Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence just for the duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. [3b] otherwise, women of childbearing potential participating must agree to use one highly effective method (less than 1% failure rate) of contraception, or a combination of 2 effective methods of contraception for the entirety of the study. [A] women of childbearing potential participating must test negative for pregnancy prior to initiation of treatment as indicated by a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening visit followed by a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to exposure. [B] either one highly effective method of contraception or a combination of 2 effective methods of contraception will be used. The patient may choose to use a double barrier method of contraception. Barrier protection methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not a reliable or acceptable method. Thus, each barrier method must include use of a spermicide. It should be noted that the use of male and female condoms as a double barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high failure rate when these methods are combined. [3c] women not of childbearing potential may participate, and include those who are: [A] infertile due to surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation), congenital anomaly such as mullerian agenesis Or [B] postmenopausal, defined as either: [i] a woman at least 50 years of age with an intact uterus, not on hormone therapy, who has had either: [a] cessation of menses for at least 1 year, or [b] at least 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with a follicle-stimulating hormone >40 mIU/mL; or [ii] a woman 55 or older not on hormone therapy, who has had at least 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or [iii] a woman at least 55 years of age with a diagnosis of menopause prior to starting hormone replacement therapy",
