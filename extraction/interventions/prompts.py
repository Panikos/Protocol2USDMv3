LLM Prompts for Interventions & Products Extraction.

These prompts guide the LLM to extract study interventions and products
from protocol investigational product sections.
"""

INTERVENTIONS_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are an expert at extracting study intervention information from clinical trial protocols.

- Route (oral, IV, SC, IM, etc.)
- Duration of treatment

### 5. Medical Devices (if applicable)

- Purpose

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "interventions": [
    {
      "name": "ALXN1840",
      "role": "Investigational Product",
      "description": "Investigational product for Wilson disease"
    },
    {
      "name": "Placebo",
      "role": "Placebo",
      "description": "Matching placebo tablets"
    }
  ],
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "ALXN1840 tablets",
      "doseForm": "Tablet",
      "strength": "15 mg",
      "manufacturer": "Alexion Pharmaceuticals"
    }

  "substances": [

      "name": "bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate",
      "description": "Active pharmaceutical ingredient"

  "administrations": [

      "duration": "24 weeks"

      "route": "Oral",
      "duration": "After Day 29"
    }
  ],
  "devices": []
}
```

## Rules

1. **Extract from IP section** - Usually Section 5 or 6 (Investigational Product)
2. **Include all dosing regimens** - Different doses, titration steps
3. **Use standard terminology**:
   - Roles: "Investigational Product", "Comparator", "Placebo", "Rescue Medication", "Concomitant Medication"
   - Routes: "Oral", "Intravenous", "Subcutaneous", "Intramuscular", "Topical", "Inhalation"
   - Forms: "Tablet", "Capsule", "Solution", "Injection", "Cream", "Patch"
4. **Be precise with doses** - Include units (mg, mg/kg, mg/m2, etc.)
5. **Return ONLY valid JSON** - no markdown, no explanations

Now analyze the protocol content and extract the interventions:
"""


INTERVENTIONS_PAGE_FINDER_PROMPT = """Analyze these PDF pages and identify which pages contain intervention/product information.

Look for pages that contain:
1. **Investigational Product section** - Usually Section 5 or 6
2. **Study Treatment section**
3. **Dose and Administration section**
4. **Product description/formulation**

Return a JSON object:
```json
{
  "intervention_pages": [page_numbers],
  "confidence": "high/medium/low",
  "notes": "any relevant observations"
}
```

Pages are 0-indexed. Return ONLY valid JSON.
