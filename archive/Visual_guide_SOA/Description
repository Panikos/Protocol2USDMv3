Element	Visual Representation in Excel	Explanation
StudyDesign	The entire worksheet structure and title.	The overall layout, including the title "Study Design: Placebo-Controlled Trial for Drug-X," represents the central structure of the study.
StudyArm	The top-level, color-coded column headers (Purple).	The highest level of grouping, separating participants into different treatment arms like "Drug-X Arm" and "Placebo Arm."
Epoch	The second-level, merged column headers (Blue).	These represent the major phases of the study, such as "Screening," "Treatment," and "Follow-up," nested under each StudyArm.
Encounter	The third-level column headers (Green).	These define the specific visit windows or encounters within each Epoch, like "Screening Visit" or "Week 2 Visit."
PlannedTimepoint	The most granular column headers (the actual visit names).	These are the specific moments when activities are scheduled to occur (e.g., "Screening," "Day 1," "Week 2"). In this example, they are the same as the Encounter labels.
ActivityGroup	Indented or grouped rows with a bolded header (Orange text).	This provides an optional grouping for related activities. For example, "Hematology" and "Chemistry" are grouped under "Safety Labs."
Activity	The individual procedure rows.	These are the specific "what" actions being performed, listed down the first column (e.g., "Informed Consent," "Vital Signs").
ActivityTimepoint	The "X" marks in the grid.	This is the most crucial element, as it creates the link between an Activity (the row) and a PlannedTimepoint (the column), showing what happens when.
StudyElement	The sequence of Epochs and Encounters across the top.	The StudyElement defines the path a participant takes through the trial. This is visually represented by reading the Epoch and Encounter headers from left to right for a specific StudyArm.
