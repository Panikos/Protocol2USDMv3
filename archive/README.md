## Archived Components

### Legacy Pipeline (`legacy_pipeline/`)

These scripts implemented the old multi-step pipeline with complex reconciliation:

| File | Original Purpose | Replaced By |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `main.py` | Old entry point | `main_v2.py` |
| `reconcile_soa_llm.py` | Merge text + vision | `extraction/validator.py` |
| `vision_extract_soa.py` | Full SoA from images | `extraction/header_analyzer.py` |
| `send_pdf_to_llm.py` | Text extraction | `extraction/text_extractor.py` |
| `soa_postprocess_consolidated.py` | Heavy post-processing | `processing/` module |
| `find_soa_pages.py` | Page detection | `extraction/soa_finder.py` |
| `analyze_soa_structure.py` | Structure analysis | `extraction/header_analyzer.py` |
| `generate_soa_llm_prompt.py` | Prompt generation | Built into extractors |
| `map_epochs_encounters_llm.py` | Epoch/encounter mapping | Built into header analyzer |

### Optimization Scripts (`optimization/`)

Experimental prompt optimization tools:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `benchmark_prompts.py` | Prompt benchmarking |
| `optimize_all_prompts.py` | Batch optimization |
| `prompt_optimizer.py` | Optimization logic |
| `compare_benchmark_results.py` | Results comparison |

### Legacy Tests (`tests_legacy/`)

Old test files that may need updating:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `test_optimizer.py` | Tests for prompt optimizer |
| `validate_soa_structure.py` | Structure validation |
| `validate_usdm_schema.py` | Schema validation |

### Workaround Scripts (root of archive/)

| File | Original Purpose | Replaced By |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `fix_provenance_keys.py` | Align provenance IDs | Consistent ID generation |
| `fix_reconciled_soa.py` | Fix reconciliation bugs | Eliminated reconciliation |
| `apply_clinical_corrections.py` | Manual hallucination fixes | Better prompts + validation |
| `align_structure.py` | Restructure USDM output | Correct structure from start |
| `regenerate_instances.py` | Transform flat timeline | Correct structure from start |
| `audit_timepoints.py` | Debug timepoint issues | Integrated into validation |

## Recovery

If you need to restore any of these files:
1. Copy from this directory back to root
2. Or recover from git history

## New Architecture

See `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for the new modular architecture.
